<h2>UX & Market Research Analysis</h2>
<p>Early in the project, external UX Researchers were brought in to assist in the redesign of the penguin.com.au site. I began the project within the UX/UI Design team responsible for translating early wireframes to finished design. Later, I was made Lead Designer and took over the creation of a simple design system.

<p>We created wireframes and simple prototypes to quickly test ideas and iterate on the provided wireframes.

Physical Book
</h2>
<p>One takeout from the research was the importance of the book as a physical object.</p><p> People responded well to a photo of a book on a bedside table, or next to a coffee in a nice cafe. With thousands of titles, and a regular release schedule, photographing or manually creating mockups of popular titles was a mammoth task.</p><p>
To tackle this, I photographed a series of 60 blank books in common settings and cropped the images to standard social media sizes. I then built an online script using PHP and ImageMagick to fetch the cover image from our server, and render it directly onto these photos and return a high resolution JPG.</p>

<div class="divider"><div class="dividerInner"></div></div><h2>Design</h2>
<p>Penguin had never used a design system before. As the development was being done in react, the project lent itself to breaking the design into components. I added some additional documentation to create a simple design system. Introducing a grid and a typographic style guide further simplified the handover.

<p>After the initial designs were signed off, I continued to work closely with the Development team. As the launch deadline approached, I adapted and simplified the design, reusing existing react components in several places and offering design solutions where usability issues arose.
